# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Business Indentifier

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website the filters small business in your area. The ones you might miss with just a simple google serch. Possibly, a verifying system?

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

2 files. 1 that has all the business sorted, adding onto the list. It will also possibly verify each businesses certificates, liscenses, etc. the secong will read from that file and give the user a list of options based on key words. All the business will be placed into categories and there will be a list of words associated with them.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I can definitely get the program to sort through a list or dictionary of businesses and vendors in the programs and give the user a list back.
 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I can get it to verify the way I want it to, that would make my project better.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a running program that both veryfying through other socia media platforms and allows the user to leave uncensored ratings but also allowing the businesses to rebuttle with proof etc. I would really want a transparent platform.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I woud really need to research more about business liscenses and what is necessary to run a business. Like what seperates necessity from luxury. Then also how to use Python as a verication tool in the most sufficient manner.
